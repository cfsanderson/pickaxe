# Notes on Programming Ruby by Dave Thomas

Below are my personal note for the Programming Ruby book by Dave Thomas.

_____
## 1.4
By using the "shebang" notation at the top of a file...
```
#!/usr/bin/ruby
puts "Hello, world"
```
and changing the mode of the file using `chmod +x <filename>` you can make a ruby file executable. Enter `ruby <./filename>` in the command line to execute.

## 1.5
- `ri --help`

I have set `export RI="--format ansi --width 70"` in .zshrc
